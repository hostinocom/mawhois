Thanks to native integration of the EPP protocol used by ANRT, it ensures reliable, secure communication that complies with the technical requirements of the Moroccan registry. This module simplifies operational management while guaranteeing optimal service quality for end users.",
			"One of the major innovations introduced by ANRT is the addition of the mandatory NID (National ID) field, now required during registration, transfer, or contact update operations. The module fully integrates this requirement: it verifies the presence of the NID, prevents incomplete orders, and correctly transmits the data to the registry via dedicated EPP commands. This native compliance prevents provisioning errors and ensures that all operations comply with .MA registry rules.",
			"The module also includes an on-demand synchronization function via the ANRT SRS. At any time, administrators can trigger a request to retrieve the actual state of domains: expiration dates, statuses, EPP locks, possible suspensions, or renewals performed directly through the registry. This manual synchronization guarantees perfect alignment between WHMCS and the registry, preventing data discrepancies without depending on a daily automatic cycle.",
			"In addition to this flexible synchronization, the module supports all essential EPP operations: creation and update of contacts, domain registration, transfers with auth-code, DNS server modifications, EPP lock/unlock, and scheduled deletions. All actions are executed in real-time, with clear feedback in WHMCS, enhancing operational efficiency for the provider."
