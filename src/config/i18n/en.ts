It allows anyone to view public information about a .MA domain, such as the registered holder, the accredited registrar, and the DNS servers currently assigned to the domain.",
                "In simple terms, it works like a digital ID card for Moroccan domain names. This transparency strengthens trust, security, and accountability within the Moroccan digital ecosystem.

                "Yes — providing official identification is now a mandatory requirement to register or maintain a .MA domain. Individuals must provide a valid national ID or passport, while companies must provide ICE (or RC or statutes if applicable). This verification is enforced directly by ANRT through accredited registrars.",
                "The purpose behind this rule is to reduce fraud, cybersquatting, and fake business identities online. The Moroccan digital ecosystem has become more regulated to ensure that when someone owns a .MA domain, they are fully identified and legally responsible for the content they host.",

                "WHOIS information is not managed directly by ANRT, but through your accredited registrar — the company where you registered your domain name. If you need to update ownership details, contact info, or company documentation, you must request it via your registrar.",
                "In most cases, updates require official documents to be re-validated by ANRT (e.g., change of business name, change of ID, change of legal representative). Registrars assist in verifying and submitting these documents on your behalf.",
                "It’s very important to keep your WHOIS data accurate and up to date, especially since Moroccan regulations require real and verifiable identity for .MA domains. Incorrect information can lead to delays, suspensions, or even domain deletion by the registry."

                "A .MA ownership transfer is not just a “form change”: it is treated as a <strong>legal change of rights</strong>. ANRT requires valid ID or company documents from both the current and the new holder. The registrar manages the process and sends everything to the registry for approval.",
                "This ensures that the domain is not transferred without the current owner’s consent and helps avoid disputes. It’s especially important when selling a business, rebranding, or updating company information.",

                "The domain won’t be activated until you provide proof (e.g., trademark certificate, commercial license, or a written authorization). This helps protect national institutions, public interest, and brand identity across Moroccan cyberspace.",

Even if the payment is done, the domain will not go live until the registry approves everything.",
                "This can happen for several reasons:",

                "The best step is to contact your accredited registrar to follow up on the request. They can provide details on what ANRT needs, assist with the required documentation, and ensure the file is completed. Once ANRT validates the request, the domain will automatically switch to “Active” and start working normally."

Thanks to native integration of the EPP protocol used by ANRT, it ensures reliable, secure communication that complies with the technical requirements of the Moroccan registry. This module simplifies operational management while guaranteeing optimal service quality for end users.",
			"One of the major innovations introduced by ANRT is the addition of the mandatory NID (National ID) field, now required during registration, transfer, or contact update operations. The module fully integrates this requirement: it verifies the presence of the NID, prevents incomplete orders, and correctly transmits the data to the registry via dedicated EPP commands. This native compliance prevents provisioning errors and ensures that all operations comply with .MA registry rules.",
			"The module also includes an on-demand synchronization function via the ANRT SRS. At any time, administrators can trigger a request to retrieve the actual state of domains: expiration dates, statuses, EPP locks, possible suspensions, or renewals performed directly through the registry. This manual synchronization guarantees perfect alignment between WHMCS and the registry, preventing data discrepancies without depending on a daily automatic cycle.",
			"In addition to this flexible synchronization, the module supports all essential EPP operations: creation and update of contacts, domain registration, transfers with auth-code, DNS server modifications, EPP lock/unlock, and scheduled deletions. All actions are executed in real-time, with clear feedback in WHMCS, enhancing operational efficiency for the provider."
